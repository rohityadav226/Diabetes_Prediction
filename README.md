This project pertains to the healthcare industry since we will make use of real patient data to manipulate and predict diabetes (yes or no) based on demographics and lab results. We will be creating multiple machine learning models and will be testing them on validation data. Furthermore, we will integrated the best performing model into a web app.<br>
The original data came from the Biostatistics program at Vanderbilt University in which several hundred rural African American patients were included. Multiple factors contribute to our prediction, including Cholesterol, Glucose, HDL Cholesterol, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Waist, Hip, and more.<br>
